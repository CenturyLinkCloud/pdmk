#### Plastic Data Modeling Kit [pdmk] - Graphical Application Framework

The [pdmk] toolkit provides the ability to easily model (fashion or shape) data
as if it were made of plastic. It does this by providing common layout,
presentation, data management and event component categories which work
together as easy to use generic snap-to-fit building blocks.

These blocks fit into the following 5 categories:

- Datastore Objects
  - Common interface for various data sources
- Stack Objects
  - Geometry and flow management
- View Objects
  - Datastore navigation
- Widget Objects
  - Datastore interaction
- Actions
  - Event generalization and handling
