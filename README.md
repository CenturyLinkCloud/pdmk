Plastic Data Modeling Kit [pdmk] - Graphical Application Framework

The [pdmk] toolkit provides the ability to easily model (fashion or shape) data
as if it were made of plastic. It does this by providing common layout,
presentation, data management and event component categories which work
together as easy to use generic snap-to-fit building blocks.

These blocks fit into the following 5 categories:

    Datastore Objects
        Common interface for various data sources
    Stack Objects
        Geometry and flow management
    View Objects
        Datastore navigation
    Widget Objects
        Datastore interaction
    Actions
        Event generalization and handling
